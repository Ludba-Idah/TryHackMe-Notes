# Room: Networking Concepts

**Category:** Networking
## Overview
This room covers foundational network models (OSI vs TCP/IP), IP addressing, port numbers, and core transport protocols.

## Core Commands & Syntax
* `ping target_ip` -> Sends ICMP Echo Requests to verify if a remote host is online and reachable.
* `tracert target_ip` -> Displays the route and hop-by-hop path packets take across routers to reach a destination host.

## Key Takeaways
* **OSI vs TCP/IP Models:** The OSI model is a 7-layer theoretical framework used for standardizing network functions, while TCP/IP is the practical 4-layer suite used on real networks.
* **IP Addresses vs Ports:** IP addresses identify unique devices on a network, whereas port numbers (0–65535) direct incoming traffic to specific applications or services running on that device.
* **TCP vs UDP:** TCP is connection-oriented and uses a 3-way handshake to guarantee data delivery, whereas UDP is connectionless and prioritizes transmission speed over reliability.
